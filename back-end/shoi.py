Your presence makes the simplest moments feel extraordinary, and being with you has shown me a love I didn't know was possible.\nI adore everything about youâ€”the way you laugh, the way you listen, the way you make even the hardest days feel manageable. You have a warmth that draws me in, a kindness that inspires me, and a strength that amazes me. With you, I feel safe, seen, and understood in a way I've never felt before."
